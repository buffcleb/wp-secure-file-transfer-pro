# User Guide — My Vaults

This guide is for users who have been granted **Vault User** or **SFT Admin** access by a site administrator. If you can't see the **My Vaults** menu in your wp-admin sidebar, contact your administrator.

---

## Overview

A **vault** is an encrypted file container. You fill it with files, and then share it securely with people outside the site via a two-factor verification flow — recipients receive an invite email, confirm their address, and verify a one-time code before they can download anything.

The **My Vaults** dashboard is at **wp-admin → My Vaults**.

## Your Vaults List

The list shows all your vaults with:
- **Status** — active, expired, or archived.
- **Files** — count of encrypted files stored in the vault.
- **Shares** — count of share links created for the vault.
- **Created** and **Expires** — dates in the site's configured timezone.

Click any column header to sort the list by that column. Click again to reverse the sort direction.

Click a vault name or **Open** to manage its files, shares, and activity log.

### Vault statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Active | Files can be uploaded; share links can be created |
| Expired | Past the vault's expiry date. No new uploads or shares. Existing active shares stop working. |
| Archived | Closed by an administrator. Behaves like expired. |
| Revoked | Closed by an administrator. Behaves like expired. |

## Creating a Vault

Use the **Create New Vault** form at the bottom of the My Vaults page.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Vault Name | Yes | Short label — e.g. "Q1 Reports" or "Onboarding Pack – Jane Smith" |
| Description | No | Internal note visible only to you and administrators |
| Expiry Date | No | Date after which the vault and its shares stop working. Leave blank for no expiry (if your admin permits). |

After creating the vault you are taken directly to its detail page.

## Vault Detail Page

### Editing vault name and description

Click **Edit Name & Description** at the top of the vault detail page to rename the vault or update its description. Changes take effect immediately and are recorded in the activity log. Files and shares are not affected.

### Editing vault expiry

Click **Edit Expiry** at the top of the vault detail page to change or clear the expiry date.

## Uploading Files

In the **Files** section, click **Encrypt & Upload** to open the upload form.

- Select one or more files at once — the file picker accepts multiple selections.
- Files upload sequentially. Each file gets its own progress row showing its name and upload state.
- Files are encrypted on the server before being written to disk. The original unencrypted version is never stored.
- Large files are uploaded in chunks, so you can upload files larger than the server's PHP `upload_max_filesize` limit.
- The maximum file size and permitted file types are configured by your administrator.
- If a file fails (type restriction, quota exceeded, server error), its row shows an error and the remaining files continue uploading.

### Deleting files

Click **Delete** next to a file. Deletion is permanent — the encrypted file is removed from disk immediately and cannot be recovered.

---

## Sharing a Vault

In the **Shares** section, use the **Share this vault** form to invite a recipient.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Recipient Email | The email address of the person you want to share with |
| Download Limit | Maximum number of times the vault can be downloaded (0 = unlimited, if your admin permits) |
| Link Expires | Date after which the share link stops working (leave blank for no expiry, if permitted) |

Click **Send Invite**. The recipient receives an email with a unique link.

### How the recipient receives the files

The two-factor share flow:

1. **Invite email** — recipient receives an email with a unique link. The link encodes a secret token; it is single-use for the OTP step.
2. **Email confirmation** — recipient opens the link and enters their email address to verify they are the intended recipient.
3. **One-time code** — a 6-digit code is emailed to the recipient. They have a limited time to enter it (configured by your admin, default 15 minutes). A cooldown may be configured — if so, the recipient must wait before requesting another code.
4. **Download access** — after successful verification, the recipient sees all files in the vault and can download them individually. If the vault has more than one file and the server supports it, a **Download All as ZIP** button also appears.

A 30-minute download session is issued after successful verification.

</p>

### Editing a share

While a share is pending or active, click **Edit** next to it to change the download limit or expiry date without revoking and recreating the share.

### Revoking a share

Click **Revoke** to immediately block the recipient's access. Any active download session they hold is invalidated. The share record is retained in the activity log for audit purposes.

### Expiry warning emails

If your administrator has enabled expiry warnings, you will receive an email a configurable number of days before each share link is due to expire. Each share triggers at most one warning. If you receive a warning and want to extend the share, edit its expiry date before it lapses.

## Activity Log

The **Activity Log** section shows the 20 most recent events for this vault — uploads, downloads, share events, OTP verifications, and more. Each entry shows:

- **Event** — what happened.
- **Details** — contextual information (e.g. file name, share recipient).
- **IP** — the IP address of the actor.
- **Date/Time** — in the site's configured timezone.

The log is read-only. Click any column header to sort.

Administrators can see the full unfiltered audit log across all vaults at **Secure Transfer → Audit Log**.

## WordPress Dashboard Widget

If your administrator has enabled it, a **Secure File Transfer — My Vaults** widget appears on your WordPress dashboard (wp-admin home). It shows your vault and file counts, active share count, and your last 5 activity events at a glance.

## Shortcode (Front-End)

The `[sft_my_vaults]` shortcode renders equivalent vault management functionality on any front-end WordPress page. All the same create/upload/share/revoke features are available. Useful for sites that want to keep editors or clients out of wp-admin entirely.
